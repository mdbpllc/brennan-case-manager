# Session Log

Purpose: a dated, running record of what happened session to session in this project — decisions made, progress, and open threads — separate from `case-management-project-instructions.md` (which stays the single canonical, always-current spec for the case management build).

**How to use this doc (for any Claude session working in this project):**
- At the **start** of a session touching this project's work, skim the most recent 2-3 entries below to pick up where things left off, especially "Next" items.
- At the **end** of a substantive session (design decisions made, work completed, open questions raised), add a new dated entry at the top of the log below, in the format shown.
- Keep entries short — a few lines each. This is a pointer/recap layer, not a duplicate of the full spec. Detailed specs live in their own docs (`case-management-project-instructions.md`, `pi-case-playbooks.md`, `criminal-offense-playbooks.md`, etc.) — link to those rather than repeating their content here.
- Do not let this file grow unbounded — if it gets long, consider archiving older entries to a dated sub-file and keeping only the most recent months here.

## 2026-07-23 (billing module Phase 1a BUILT — overnight session)

**What happened (Claude Code session):** Phase 1a built end-to-end per the synthesis doc (Part 3 1a scope, Part 4 data model, Part 5 guardrails) in two commits, verified live in demo mode, build + oxlint clean. Delivered: Medical tab on case detail (bill list, §10 Type 1/2 ledger math in the case roll-up, batch analyze, report list); per-bill workspace (editable ledger with Type 2 reconciliation check, claim-type detection + attorney override + hard facility caveat, EOB card with source-pinned patient-responsibility field, line-item table with chargemaster-memory trigram suggestions and confidence badges, attorney confirm/reject/manual-CPT flows, deterministic coding audit, provisional→confirmed analysis runs, ratio-led internal report generator with registry stamps and disclaimer v1); **Legal Rule Registry as system-wide infrastructure** (all nine Part 7 propositions seeded UNVERIFIED; verify action = attorney sign-off in the UI, nothing programmatic sets verified); Benchmarks page (fee-schedule library + CSV import for real CMS PFS data — demo schedule with fictional rates ships so the flow is clickable). Supabase schema + adapter extended in parallel (pg_trgm, RLS matching existing posture); trigram matching implemented in TS so demo and Supabase modes behave identically.

**Implementation decisions (in-code, no spec impact):** disclaimer text shipped as v1-draft pending Michael's review; scenario tier = unconfirmed suggested mappings computed separately and clearly labeled (B2-light); confirmed-only totals feed the headline ratio and roll-up.

**Deferred/open:** real Medicare PFS data import (CSV importer ready — needs Michael in the loop to pull the TX-locality export); backlog items 3–4 (structured addresses, health-insurer party type) NOT folded in — left for Michael's call; ProviderBillingProfile is Phase 4; no run archival/deletion yet.

**Next:** Michael walks through Phase 1a and gives feedback; import real PFS data together; then Phase 2 (lien war chest / MRF loader) or backlog per Michael's priorities.

## 2026-07-22 (v0.1 walkthrough — SIGNED OFF + feedback captured)

**What happened:** Michael ran the v0.1 slice (Case overview + Parties) and walked through it live. Verdict: v0.1 approved as-is — layout and structure match how he works; the only surprise was scope (he expected more built out), which is expected for a first vertical slice. The v0.1-feedback gate on billing Phase 1a is now CLEARED.

**Confirmed working as intended:** the `priorRecordVerified` DPS/background-check checkbox on party intake — the unverified-until-checked flag on eligibility readouts (advisory flag, not a hard stop) is the behavior Michael wants. No change.

**New backlog items (deferred — do NOT build now, capture only):**

1. Texas district court directory — map and store all Texas district courts in the system so courts are selected from a canonical list rather than typed freehand. Feeds deadline engine and filing logic downstream.
2. Client detail / intake section — deeper buildout. Current fields work but are too shallow. Expand beyond the existing list (prior motor vehicle collisions, falls, injuries, medical providers seen, driving history, prior tickets, prior criminal history). Add gating logic — e.g. a yes/no "has the client ever been arrested?" that collapses follow-up fields when No — with the caveat Michael flagged: a conviction can exist without an arrest, so the gate logic must not be naive. Before building, find a real intake form/source to model the field set on rather than inventing it. Note: interacts with the existing structured prior-history requirements in `plea-hearing-eligibility-reminder.md` §3 — don't design in isolation from that.
3. Structured address fields — replace single free-text mailing address with discrete fields: address line 1, address line 2 (suite/apt), city, state, ZIP (three separate boxes for city/state/ZIP). Rationale: addresses must be reassembled into multiple output formats (signature blocks, recipient headers on demand letters), which is impossible from one mushed field. Painful to retrofit — do this before address data accumulates.
4. New party type: Health Insurance Company — currently missing from the party-type dropdown in `partyRegistry.ts`. Prerequisite for item 5.
5. Type-ahead lookup on health insurer field — typing "unit" surfaces a dropdown of insurers already saved in the system (e.g. UnitedHealthcare) for selection rather than re-entry. Keeps names consistent across cases. Same fuzzy-match-from-memory pattern already specced for chargemaster lookups in the billing module. Depends on item 4.

**Open (unchanged):** Citizens MRF median-column compliance sub-question still requires attorney sign-off (synthesis Part 7). Michael's direction: don't over-invest in that single dataset — broaden the MRF corpus instead, starting with all San Antonio hospitals, then scaling to Texas statewide. Target-list assembly (systems + transparency-page URLs) not yet done.

**Next:** billing module Phase 1a build (gate cleared) — re-attach current codebase in a fresh build chat. Backlog items 1–5 are post-1a unless Michael reprioritizes; items 3 and 4 are cheap and schema-adjacent, so consider folding them into the 1a branch if they don't expand scope.

## 2026-07-21 (second review pass: robustness + schema hardening)

**What happened (Claude Code session):** Re-reviewed the whole codebase after the cleanup pass and fixed the stragglers: bad-URL/missing-record pages now show "not found" notices instead of loading forever; list and detail pages surface a visible error when the database can't be reached (this is what a user will see in Supabase mode until auth lands); role/side pickers now share one `CASE_ROLES`/`SIDES` source in `types.ts`; `db/schema.sql` hardened — RLS enabled on `file_counters` (it was the one table exposed to any key-holder) with `next_file_number()` made SECURITY DEFINER (no live DB yet, so no migration needed). Retested the "Enter doesn't submit the party form" observation — withdrawn as a test-harness artifact; notes corrected. Verified index.css is complete (no missing badge classes). Build + oxlint clean; not-found pages verified live.

**Next:** Michael takes docs/spec-feedback.md to the design space; then billing module Phase 1a.

## 2026-07-21 (cleanup + improvements pass)

**What happened (Claude Code session):** Fixed everything actionable from the review: the UTC "date opened" bug (new `src/domain/dates.ts` local-date helper); repeating-group button labels (new `itemLabel` on field defs); tabs are now URL-driven (`/cases/:id/parties`) so creating a party returns you to the Parties tab; list rows expose real links; the "not yet filled in" footer collapses; `isClosedStatus()` centralizes the closed check; localStorage store is versioned (stale stores reseed); `updateParty` narrowed to displayName+fields in the adapter interface; bulk `getCases`/`getParties` added to kill N+1 fetches; **PI flags, commercial policy, and representation type are now editable on the case Overview tab** (practice area / case type stay frozen pending a spec decision). README: Supabase auth gap noted, docs/specs pointer added. Created `docs/spec-feedback.md` with the five open design-space items (probate ladder, Supabase auth, archive/void, party-type promotion, MRF path). Two corrections to BUILD-SESSION-NOTES (file-number year is local, not UTC; README was already app-specific). Build + oxlint clean; all changes verified live in the browser.

**Next:** Michael takes the spec-feedback items to the design space (hand-back prompt provided in session); then billing module Phase 1a.

## 2026-07-21 (v0.1 test drive + codebase review)

**What happened (Claude Code session):** Installed Node.js LTS 24.18.0 (machine had none — v0.1 had never run here), ran the app, and did a hands-on click-through in demo mode plus a full codebase read. Findings written up in `BUILD-SESSION-NOTES.md` (repo root): structure summary, what works, and a gaps list. Headliners: a UTC bug makes "date opened" default to tomorrow every evening; Supabase mode can't work yet (RLS policies require `authenticated` but there's no login); case classification/flags can't be edited after creation. No console errors; no broken imports or TODOs.

**Next:** Michael reviews BUILD-SESSION-NOTES.md alongside his v0.1 feedback; fix the UTC date bug; then billing module Phase 1a.

## 2026-07-21 (build environment stood up)

**What happened (Claude Code session):** Build environment stood up. Repo initialized under git with `.env` protection in `.gitignore` and moved to its permanent home. Spec docs committed under `docs/specs/`. CLAUDE.md created by merging the conventions block into the repo-generated structural half — block wins on rules; spec list corrected (it was missing `medical-billing-analysis-module-prompt.md` and this session log, now documented as the one append-allowed exception to the read-only-specs rule); transport file deleted after the merge (original preserved in git history). Pushed to private GitHub at `mdbpllc/brennan-case-manager`.

**Open item:** record the Citizens MRF local path in CLAUDE.md once chosen.

**Next:** Michael's v0.1 feedback, then billing module Phase 1a.

## 2026-07-21 (build moves to Claude Code; conventions block drafted)

**What happened:** Assessed whether the build should move to Claude Code — yes: design/spec work stays in this Project space (canonical), coding happens in Claude Code against the repo on Michael's machine. Rather than drafting a full CLAUDE.md blind, drafted only the **project-conventions block** (spec canonicity, Legal Rule Registry discipline incl. the unverified-2025-legislation rule, data hygiene for privileged data, build sequence with Phase 1a as current target and 1b gated, working style). Structural half comes from Claude Code's `/init` reading the real tree; conventions block wins on conflicts of discipline, generated half wins on paths/commands.

**Decisions:**
- Repo goes under git before any Claude Code session edits it (first task).
- Spec snapshots committed under `docs/specs/`; coding sessions read but never rewrite them — build-revealed spec issues go to `docs/spec-feedback.md` and come back here.
- No real client data ever committed; Citizens MRF fixture referenced by local path, not committed.
- Project-knowledge housekeeping: the six docs formerly grouped in the "claude" folder are re-uploaded as individual files (folder grouping blocked single-file replacement); session log consolidated to this single file.

**Open (for Michael, parked in the block's footer comment):** (1) local-only vs. private GitHub — private GitHub recommended; (2) confirm the committed spec list; (3) record the MRF local path in the generated CLAUDE.md half.

**Next:** Michael: git init + commit code, specs, and conventions block → run `/init` in Claude Code → merge. Then (unchanged) v0.1 feedback, then Phase 1a build in Claude Code.

## 2026-07-22 (billing module decisions + MRF dry run COMPLETED)

**What happened:** Worked through the billing-module synthesis doc's Part 6 decision queue and Part 8 discussion items with Michael — all resolved. Ran the Citizens Medical Center MRF dry run **to completion**: remote fetches first hit a stale cached v2.0.0 copy; Michael then downloaded the live 55 MB file (chat upload timed out — worked around by zipping it and staging via the desktop folder bridge from his Downloads folder), and the full per-code analysis ran on the real file.

**Decisions:**
- All eight decision-queue defaults ACCEPTED, with refinements: Phase 1 reports lead with billed-to-Medicare ratios; only CONFIRMED AnalysisRuns feed settlement/lien math; paralegal flip at multi-user is manual per-workflow; OPPS Addendum B noted as Phase 2 outpatient-facility fallback. Details: synthesis doc Part 6.
- **Legal Rule Registry PROMOTED to system-wide core infrastructure now** — project instructions §2 updated; banked feature #13 (citation-currency alerts) folded in.
- **Billing-module Phase 1a is the SECOND vertical slice** (after Michael's v0.1 feedback). Phase 1 split into 1a (deterministic — minimal Medical tab, manual/assisted line-item entry, chargemaster fuzzy match, Medicare PFS benchmarks, report generator) and 1b (local-AI PDF ingestion, gated on the GPU arm).

**Dry-run outcome (`claude/citizens-mrf-dry-run.md`, v2):** Citizens' current file is **CMS v3.0.0, dated 2026-05-11, attested, with BCBS negotiated dollar rates for the exact exercise codes** (70450 CT head: $487.55 BCBS PPO outpatient vs $3,166 gross); median/percentile columns essentially unpopulated (5 of ~33k rows) → usable evidence tier = negotiated dollar, not attested median. Facility rates ran 4–10× the professional-schedule estimate from the original exercise (claim-type disclaimer empirically vindicated) while still ~20–50% of billed. Anomalies found and specced into the Phase 2 loader: setting-split rates, above-gross outpatient ED E/M rates, CPT reuse across chargemaster lines, stale CDN caching, defective CMS TXT indicator. The Citizens file is the Phase 2 reference fixture (copy staged this session; Michael has the original in Downloads).

**Docs updated:** `claude/medical-billing-analysis-module-synthesis.md` (v2.1 — decisions + dry-run corrections), `case-management-project-instructions.md` (registry promotion, second slice, billing hooks), `claude/citizens-mrf-dry-run.md` (v2, completed).

**Next:** (1) Michael runs slice v0.1 + feedback; (2) billing Phase 1a build chat (re-attach current codebase first); (3) registry verification items remain open per synthesis Part 7 — attorney sign-off required, incl. the new sub-question whether an attested v3.0.0 file with empty median columns is compliant.

## 2026-07-22

**What happened:** Michael asked whether Claude uses "Memory" in this project, prompting a discussion of Anthropic's memory tool (a client-side API feature for developers) versus what's actually available here — the Project's persistent docs. Set up this session log as the practical equivalent. Discussed reliability (a new session isn't guaranteed to check/update it — it's instruction-driven, not automatic) and token cost of making that more reliable. Decided against backfilling history from old chats (not worth it — `case-management-project-instructions.md` already captures the substance, and old chat transcripts aren't accessible to a session anyway). Added a short pointer line to the top of `case-management-project-instructions.md` referencing this log, to raise the odds a session checks it (that doc already gets read reliably every session) without merging the log's growing content into it (which would add token cost to every read).

**Decisions:**
- This log lives at `claude/session-log.md`, is checked at the start of relevant sessions, and updated at the end of substantive ones.
- It complements, not replaces, `case-management-project-instructions.md` as the master spec.
- `case-management-project-instructions.md` now carries a one-line pointer to this log (added under its opening paragraph) rather than having log entries merged into it — keeps the reliability benefit without the token cost of the log's history being re-read every time the instructions doc is read.
- No backfill of past chat history into this log — start clean from today; pull forward specific gaps only if they surface later.

**Note:** mid-edit, a `project_write` to `case-management-project-instructions.md` accidentally replaced the full document with just the new opening lines (project_write overwrites the whole doc, not a patch) — caught immediately and restored from the content still held in context. No data lost, but a reminder that edits to that doc need the complete file resent each time, not a snippet.

**Next:** No open build item from this conversation. Resume from `case-management-project-instructions.md` §14 "Open action items" for the actual case-management-software build status (vertical slice v0.1 awaiting Michael's feedback; three Bar consult items pending; etc.).
