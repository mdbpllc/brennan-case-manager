# Session Log

Purpose: a dated, running record of what happened session to session in this project — decisions made, progress, and open threads — separate from `case-management-project-instructions.md` (which stays the single canonical, always-current spec for the case management build).

**How to use this doc (for any Claude session working in this project):**
- At the **start** of a session touching this project's work, skim the most recent 2-3 entries below to pick up where things left off, especially "Next" items.
- At the **end** of a substantive session (design decisions made, work completed, open questions raised), add a new dated entry at the top of the log below, in the format shown.
- Keep entries short — a few lines each. This is a pointer/recap layer, not a duplicate of the full spec. Detailed specs live in their own docs (`case-management-project-instructions.md`, `pi-case-playbooks.md`, `criminal-offense-playbooks.md`, etc.) — link to those rather than repeating their content here.
- Do not let this file grow unbounded — if it gets long, consider archiving older entries to a dated sub-file and keeping only the most recent months here.

## 2026-07-21 (CLAUDE.md merged in repo; hosting decided)

**What happened (Claude Code session):** Committed the nine spec snapshots under `docs/specs/` plus the conventions block. Generated CLAUDE.md from the real repo tree (commands, adapter architecture) and merged the conventions block into it; block's spec list corrected — it was missing `medical-billing-analysis-module-prompt.md` and this session log. Session log documented in CLAUDE.md as the one append-allowed exception to the read-only-specs rule. The transport file `claude-md-conventions-block.md` was deleted after the merge (content lives in CLAUDE.md; original preserved in git history). Michael decided hosting: **private GitHub** — repo created and pushed.

**Next:** Michael's v0.1 feedback; billing module Phase 1a. Open decision: local path for the Citizens MRF fixture (record in CLAUDE.md when chosen).

## 2026-07-21 (build moves to Claude Code; conventions block drafted)

**What happened:** Assessed whether the build should move to Claude Code — yes: design/spec work stays in this Project space (canonical), coding happens in Claude Code against the repo on Michael's machine. Rather than drafting a full CLAUDE.md blind, drafted only the **project-conventions block** (spec canonicity, Legal Rule Registry discipline incl. the unverified-2025-legislation rule, data hygiene for privileged data, build sequence with Phase 1a as current target and 1b gated, working style). Structural half comes from Claude Code's `/init` reading the real tree; conventions block wins on conflicts of discipline, generated half wins on paths/commands.

**Decisions:**
- Repo goes under git before any Claude Code session edits it (first task).
- Spec snapshots committed under `docs/specs/`; coding sessions read but never rewrite them — build-revealed spec issues go to `docs/spec-feedback.md` and come back here.
- No real client data ever committed; Citizens MRF fixture referenced by local path, not committed.
- Project-knowledge housekeeping: the six docs formerly grouped in the "claude" folder are re-uploaded as individual files (folder grouping blocked single-file replacement); session log consolidated to this single file.

**Open (for Michael, parked in the block's footer comment):** (1) local-only vs. private GitHub — private GitHub recommended; (2) confirm the committed spec list; (3) record the MRF local path in the generated CLAUDE.md half.

**Next:** Michael: git init + commit code, specs, and conventions block → run `/init` in Claude Code → merge. Then (unchanged) v0.1 feedback, then Phase 1a build in Claude Code.

## 2026-07-22 (billing module decisions + MRF dry run COMPLETED)

**What happened:** Worked through the billing-module synthesis doc's Part 6 decision queue and Part 8 discussion items with Michael — all resolved. Ran the Citizens Medical Center MRF dry run **to completion**: remote fetches first hit a stale cached v2.0.0 copy; Michael then downloaded the live 55 MB file (chat upload timed out — worked around by zipping it and staging via the desktop folder bridge from his Downloads folder), and the full per-code analysis ran on the real file.

**Decisions:**
- All eight decision-queue defaults ACCEPTED, with refinements: Phase 1 reports lead with billed-to-Medicare ratios; only CONFIRMED AnalysisRuns feed settlement/lien math; paralegal flip at multi-user is manual per-workflow; OPPS Addendum B noted as Phase 2 outpatient-facility fallback. Details: synthesis doc Part 6.
- **Legal Rule Registry PROMOTED to system-wide core infrastructure now** — project instructions §2 updated; banked feature #13 (citation-currency alerts) folded in.
- **Billing-module Phase 1a is the SECOND vertical slice** (after Michael's v0.1 feedback). Phase 1 split into 1a (deterministic — minimal Medical tab, manual/assisted line-item entry, chargemaster fuzzy match, Medicare PFS benchmarks, report generator) and 1b (local-AI PDF ingestion, gated on the GPU arm).

**Dry-run outcome (`claude/citizens-mrf-dry-run.md`, v2):** Citizens' current file is **CMS v3.0.0, dated 2026-05-11, attested, with BCBS negotiated dollar rates for the exact exercise codes** (70450 CT head: $487.55 BCBS PPO outpatient vs $3,166 gross); median/percentile columns essentially unpopulated (5 of ~33k rows) → usable evidence tier = negotiated dollar, not attested median. Facility rates ran 4–10× the professional-schedule estimate from the original exercise (claim-type disclaimer empirically vindicated) while still ~20–50% of billed. Anomalies found and specced into the Phase 2 loader: setting-split rates, above-gross outpatient ED E/M rates, CPT reuse across chargemaster lines, stale CDN caching, defective CMS TXT indicator. The Citizens file is the Phase 2 reference fixture (copy staged this session; Michael has the original in Downloads).

**Docs updated:** `claude/medical-billing-analysis-module-synthesis.md` (v2.1 — decisions + dry-run corrections), `case-management-project-instructions.md` (registry promotion, second slice, billing hooks), `claude/citizens-mrf-dry-run.md` (v2, completed).

**Next:** (1) Michael runs slice v0.1 + feedback; (2) billing Phase 1a build chat (re-attach current codebase first); (3) registry verification items remain open per synthesis Part 7 — attorney sign-off required, incl. the new sub-question whether an attested v3.0.0 file with empty median columns is compliant.

## 2026-07-22

**What happened:** Michael asked whether Claude uses "Memory" in this project, prompting a discussion of Anthropic's memory tool (a client-side API feature for developers) versus what's actually available here — the Project's persistent docs. Set up this session log as the practical equivalent. Discussed reliability (a new session isn't guaranteed to check/update it — it's instruction-driven, not automatic) and token cost of making that more reliable. Decided against backfilling history from old chats (not worth it — `case-management-project-instructions.md` already captures the substance, and old chat transcripts aren't accessible to a session anyway). Added a short pointer line to the top of `case-management-project-instructions.md` referencing this log, to raise the odds a session checks it (that doc already gets read reliably every session) without merging the log's growing content into it (which would add token cost to every read).

**Decisions:**
- This log lives at `claude/session-log.md`, is checked at the start of relevant sessions, and updated at the end of substantive ones.
- It complements, not replaces, `case-management-project-instructions.md` as the master spec.
- `case-management-project-instructions.md` now carries a one-line pointer to this log (added under its opening paragraph) rather than having log entries merged into it — keeps the reliability benefit without the token cost of the log's history being re-read every time the instructions doc is read.
- No backfill of past chat history into this log — start clean from today; pull forward specific gaps only if they surface later.

**Note:** mid-edit, a `project_write` to `case-management-project-instructions.md` accidentally replaced the full document with just the new opening lines (project_write overwrites the whole doc, not a patch) — caught immediately and restored from the content still held in context. No data lost, but a reminder that edits to that doc need the complete file resent each time, not a snippet.

**Next:** No open build item from this conversation. Resume from `case-management-project-instructions.md` §14 "Open action items" for the actual case-management-software build status (vertical slice v0.1 awaiting Michael's feedback; three Bar consult items pending; etc.).
