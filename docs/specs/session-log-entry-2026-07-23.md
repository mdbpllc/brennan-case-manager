## 2026-07-23 (phone dictation → three new specs: OAA intake, Outlook sync, email intake)

**What happened:** Michael used the 2026-07-22 docket worksheet in court — content correct, but some of his cases showed only the prosecutor because the docket printed before his appointment was entered. Phone dictation session captured fixes + a suite-wide requirement; specs drafted same day at the desktop.

**New specs (committed under docs/specs/):**
- `criminal-appointment-intake-and-docket-enhancements.md` — OAA-upload matter creation (Uvalde/Real = clean digital; DeWitt = scan/OCR tier; per-county template registry), hearing auto-detect with confidence-gated calendar creation, and docket-worksheet cross-referencing against existing matters (+ email, later) before prompting Michael.
- `outlook-calendar-sync.md` — Outlook connectivity is **non-negotiable**. Phase 1 committed: one-way push, software → Outlook (incl. edits/cancels), via Graph. Phase 2 (two-way) explicitly BACKLOGGED — doable, negligible runtime cost, real engineering complexity; must not delay Phase 1.
- `outlook-email-intake.md` — EXPLORATORY only. Email flows into the system, type-driven actions; HIPAA compliance is a first-class constraint (PHI in PI-case mail). No build commitment; future brainstorming loop in the billing-module-prompt style.

**Sequencing decided:** (1) BUILD-SESSION-NOTES.md review + v0.1 feedback → (2) billing Phase 1a (unchanged) → (3) Outlook one-way push → (4) OAA intake → (5) docket cross-ref rides with docket-worksheet feature → backlog: two-way sync, email intake.

**Open:** Michael to upload sample OAAs (Uvalde/Real form + DeWitt scan; no live client data) so the field map can be finalized.

**Next:** unchanged near-term — review BUILD-SESSION-NOTES.md and Michael's v0.1 feedback, then billing Phase 1a.
